# Rebellion

A text-based, human VS computer chess variant written in Python 3. The computer player's moves are generated using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

You can play either as:

  - The Nobles: 1 King, 2 Queens or
  - The Rebels: 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops and 2 Knights   

---

The code is very bloated at the moment (redundant blocks of code here and there, lack of refactoring) The heuristics aren't perfect as well resulting in a not so challenging AI. All this will hopefully be improved in future iterations of the game.

### Running the game

If you don't have Python 3 on your machine I recommend downloading [Anaconda here.](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Anaconda will install the Python interpreter, all the necessary packages as well as automatically adding Python to the PATH environment. 

After that, just:

1. Clone the project
2. cd to project directory  
3. `python Reb_Main.py`



### Enjoy!
